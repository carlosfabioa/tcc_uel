Dear Governor and Mrs. Peixoto:

Mr. Cummings and I wish to thank you and all
your citizens for the marvelous hospitality and
warm welcome extended to us during our recent
visit in Brazil. |

We look forward to many happy visits in Brazil
for we know we are among friends while visiting
there, and we want you to know that we are singing
your country's praises to everyone here.

With many thanks and our best wishes,

Cordially,
